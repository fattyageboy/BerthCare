# Task E2 Completion Summary: CI/CD Pipeline Setup

**Task ID:** E2  
**Task Name:** Set up CI bootstrap  
**Completed:** October 10, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Overview

Successfully configured a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions that runs automated checks on all pull requests to the `main` branch. The pipeline ensures code quality, type safety, test coverage, security, and build integrity before any code is merged.

## Deliverables Completed

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

✅ **Pipeline Architecture**

- 7 parallel jobs for optimal performance
- Concurrency control to cancel outdated runs
- Timeout limits to prevent hanging jobs
- Comprehensive status reporting

✅ **Job 1: Code Quality (Lint & Format)**

- ESLint for code style enforcement
- Prettier for consistent formatting
- Max warnings: 0 (strict mode)
- Timeout: 10 minutes

✅ **Job 2: TypeScript Type Check**

- Full type safety validation
- No emit mode (fast checking)
- Timeout: 10 minutes

✅ **Job 3: Unit Tests**

- Jest test runner with coverage
- Coverage upload to Codecov
- Coverage threshold: 70%
- Timeout: 15 minutes

✅ **Job 4: Security Scan (SAST)**

## CI Pipeline Performance

### Expected Run Times

- **Code Quality**: 2-3 minutes
- **Type Check**: 2-3 minutes
- **Unit Tests**: 3-5 minutes
- **Security SAST**: 5-10 minutes
- **Dependency Audit**: 1-2 minutes
- **Build Verification**: 3-5 minutes
- **Total Pipeline**: 15-25 minutes

### Optimization Features

- ✅ Jobs run in parallel where possible
- ✅ Node.js dependencies cached between runs
- ✅ Concurrency cancels outdated workflow runs
- ✅ Timeouts prevent hanging jobs
- ✅ Fail-fast for critical errors

## Required Status Checks

The following checks must pass before merging to `main`:

1. ✅ Code Quality (Lint & Format)
2. ✅ TypeScript Type Check
3. ✅ Unit Tests
4. ✅ Dependency Audit
5. ✅ Build Verification
6. ✅ CI Summary

**Note**: Security SAST is informational and doesn't block merges.

## Configuration Requirements

### Test Database Credentials (Hardcoded - Safe)

The CI workflow includes hardcoded test database credentials:

- `TEST_DATABASE_URL`: postgresql://test_user:test_password@localhost:5432/berthcare_test
- `TEST_REDIS_URL`: redis://localhost:6379

**Security Note**: These credentials are **safe to hardcode** because:

1. They only apply to ephemeral GitHub Actions containers
2. Containers are destroyed immediately after each CI run
3. They cannot access any production or persistent infrastructure
4. The PostgreSQL and Redis services are isolated to the CI job
5. No external network access to these services

This is a standard practice for CI/CD pipelines and is explicitly allowed in our security policy for ephemeral test environments.

### GitHub Secrets (Optional)

For enhanced features, configure these secrets:

- `CODECOV_TOKEN`: Coverage reporting (get from codecov.io)
- `SNYK_TOKEN`: Snyk security scanning (get from snyk.io)

**How to add**:

1. Go to: https://github.com/fattyageboy/BerthCare/settings/secrets/actions
2. Click "New repository secret"
3. Add name and value

### Branch Protection (Required)

Must be configured manually via GitHub:

1. Go to: https://github.com/fattyageboy/BerthCare/settings/branches
2. Add rule for `main` branch
3. Enable required settings (see `.github/github-branch-protection-setup.md`)
4. Add required status checks listed above

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Create a Pull Request to Test CI**

   ```bash
   # Current branch: feat/auth-system
   # Create PR to main to trigger CI pipeline
   ```

2. **Configure Branch Protection**
   - Follow guide: `.github/github-branch-protection-setup.md`
   - Add required status checks after first CI run
   - Enable signed commits requirement

3. **Optional: Configure Secrets**
   - Add `CODECOV_TOKEN` for coverage reporting
   - Add `SNYK_TOKEN` for enhanced security scanning

### Subsequent Tasks

According to the task plan:

- **E3**: Configure development environment (Docker Compose)
- **E4**: Set up staging environment infrastructure
- **A1**: Initialize mobile app with Expo
- **B1**: Initialize backend API server

## Testing the CI Pipeline

### Local Testing (Before PR)

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run all checks locally
pnpm run lint
pnpm run format:check
pnpm run type-check
pnpm run test
pnpm run build
```

### CI Testing (After PR)

1. Create PR from `feat/auth-system` to `main`
2. Watch GitHub Actions run automatically
3. Verify all jobs complete successfully
4. Check job logs for any issues
5. Confirm status checks appear in PR

## Known Limitations

1. **Security SAST**: Requires `SNYK_TOKEN` for full functionality (optional)
2. **Coverage Upload**: Requires `CODECOV_TOKEN` for reporting (optional)
3. **Branch Protection**: Must be configured manually via GitHub UI
4. **First Run**: Status checks won't appear in branch protection until first CI run

## Troubleshooting

### If CI Fails

1. **Check GitHub Actions logs**: https://github.com/fattyageboy/BerthCare/actions
2. **Run checks locally** to reproduce the issue
3. **Review error messages** in job logs
4. **Fix issues** and push new commit
5. **CI will re-run automatically** on new push

### Common Issues

- **Lint errors**: Run `pnpm run lint:fix` to auto-fix
- **Format errors**: Run `pnpm run format` to auto-format
- **Type errors**: Check TypeScript compiler output
- **Test failures**: Run `pnpm run test:watch` to debug
- **Build failures**: Run `pnpm run build` locally

- Coverage thresholds set at 70% for quality without being overly strict
- Node.js 20 LTS chosen for long-term stability
