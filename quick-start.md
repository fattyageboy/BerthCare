# BerthCare Quick Start Guide

Get BerthCare running locally in under 5 minutes.

## Prerequisites

- **Docker Desktop** installed and running
- **Node.js 20 LTS** installed
- **Git** installed

## Step 1: Clone & Setup (1 minute)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/[organization]/berthcare.git
cd berthcare

# One-time setup (copies .env, installs dependencies)
make setup
```

## Step 2: Start Services (2 minutes)

```bash
# Start PostgreSQL, Redis, and LocalStack
make start

# Wait for services to be ready (about 30 seconds)
# Then verify everything is healthy
make verify
```

You should see:
```
âœ… Docker is running
âœ… PostgreSQL is healthy
   âœ… Databases created (berthcare_dev, berthcare_test)
âœ… Redis is healthy
âœ… LocalStack is healthy
   âœ… S3 buckets created (photos, documents, signatures)
```

## Step 3: Start Backend (1 minute)

```bash
# In a new terminal
cd apps/backend
npm run dev
```

You should see:
```
ðŸš€ Backend server running on http://localhost:3000
âœ… Connected to PostgreSQL
âœ… Connected to Redis
```

## Step 4: Start Mobile App (1 minute)

```bash
# In another new terminal
cd apps/mobile
npm start
```

Choose your platform:
- Press `i` for iOS simulator
- Press `a` for Android emulator
- Scan QR code with Expo Go app on your phone

## You're Done! ðŸŽ‰

Your local development environment is running:

- **Backend API**: http://localhost:3000
- **PostgreSQL**: localhost:5432
- **Redis**: localhost:6379
- **LocalStack S3**: http://localhost:4566

## Optional: Development Tools

Want database and cache management UIs?

```bash
# Start with development tools
make start-tools
```

Then access:
- **PgAdmin**: http://localhost:5050 (PostgreSQL web UI)
- **Redis Commander**: http://localhost:8081 (Redis web UI)

## Common Commands

```bash
make help          # Show all available commands
make verify        # Check service health
make logs-f        # View real-time logs
make stop          # Stop all services
make restart       # Restart all services
make db-shell      # Open PostgreSQL shell
make redis-cli     # Open Redis CLI
```

## Troubleshooting

### Services won't start

```bash
# Check if ports are already in use
lsof -i :5432  # PostgreSQL
lsof -i :6379  # Redis
lsof -i :4566  # LocalStack

# Stop conflicting services or change ports in .env
```

### Docker issues

```bash
# Restart Docker Desktop
# Then try again
make start
```

### Database connection errors

```bash
# Check PostgreSQL is running
docker-compose ps postgres

# View logs
docker-compose logs postgres

# Restart PostgreSQL
docker-compose restart postgres
```

### Need a fresh start?

```bash
# Stop everything and delete all data
make clean

# Start fresh
make start
```
