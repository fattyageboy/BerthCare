### Testing

#### 1. Start Infrastructure Services

```bash
# Start Docker services
docker compose up -d

# Verify all containers are running
docker compose ps
# Expected: postgres, redis, localstack all "Up" and healthy
```

#### 2. Verify Service Connectivity

```bash
# Test PostgreSQL connection
docker compose exec postgres psql -U berthcare -d berthcare_dev -c "SELECT version();"
# Expected: PostgreSQL version string

# Test Redis connection
docker compose exec redis redis-cli ping
# Expected: PONG

# Test LocalStack S3
aws --endpoint-url=http://localhost:4566 s3 ls
# Expected: List of S3 buckets or empty (no error)
```

#### 3. Run Database Migrations

```bash
cd apps/backend
pnpm install
pnpm run migrate
# Expected: "Migrations completed successfully" or similar confirmation
```

#### 4. Seed Test Data (Optional)

```bash
pnpm run seed
# Expected: "Database seeded successfully" with count of records created

# Verify seeded data
docker compose exec postgres psql -U berthcare -d berthcare_dev -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;"
# Expected: Row count > 0
```

#### 5. Run Automated Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm run test
# Expected: All tests pass, coverage ≥ 80%

# Run specific test suites
pnpm run test auth.register.test.ts
pnpm run test routes.clients.test.ts
# Expected: Individual test suites pass
```

#### 6. Start Backend Server

```bash
pnpm run dev
# Expected: Console output showing:
# - "Connected to PostgreSQL"
# - "Connected to Redis"
# - "BerthCare Backend Server started on port 3000"
```

#### 7. Verify Health Endpoint

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

**Expected Response (HTTP 200):**

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-29T12:00:00.000Z",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "environment": "development",
  "services": {
    "postgres": "connected",
    "redis": "connected"
  }
}
```

#### 8. Test API Endpoints

```bash
# Test registration endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "password": "SecurePass123",
    "firstName": "Test",
    "lastName": "User",
    "role": "caregiver",
    "zoneId": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
    "deviceId": "test-device"
  }'
# Expected: HTTP 201 with accessToken, refreshToken, and user object

# Test login endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "password": "SecurePass123",
    "deviceId": "test-device"
  }'
# Expected: HTTP 200 with accessToken, refreshToken, and user object
```

### Acceptance Criteria

#### Core Functionality

- [x] Backend connects to local PostgreSQL
- [x] Backend connects to local Redis
- [x] Logs to console with proper formatting
- [x] All services start successfully with docker-compose

#### Error Handling & Validation

- [x] Invalid requests return appropriate 4xx status codes with structured JSON error bodies

- [x] Invalid email format returns 400 with validation error
- [x] Duplicate email registration returns 409 with conflict error
- [x] Invalid credentials return 401 with authentication error
- [x] Server errors return 500 with structured error response (no stack traces in production)
- [x] All error responses include `code`, `message`, `timestamp`, and `requestId` fields

#### Security & Protection

- [x] Helmet middleware applied (security headers present in responses)
- [x] CORS configured with appropriate origins
- [x] Rate limiting active on auth endpoints (429 after threshold exceeded)
- [x] Passwords hashed with bcrypt (never stored in plaintext)
- [x] JWT tokens use RS256 algorithm with proper expiration
- [x] Refresh tokens hashed before database storage
- [x] SQL injection prevented via parameterized queries
- [x] Request body size limits enforced

#### Configuration & Startup Validation

- [x] App fails fast with clear error when required env vars missing (DATABASE_URL, REDIS_URL, JWT_SECRET)
- [x] Startup logs show successful connection to PostgreSQL and Redis
- [x] Invalid database credentials cause immediate startup failure with descriptive error
- [x] Environment validation runs before server starts listening
- [x] `.env.example` file documents all required and optional variables

### Next Steps (G2)

- [ ] Fix any ESLint/TypeScript errors
- [ ] Ensure tests pass
- [ ] Request review from senior backend dev
- [ ] Address feedback
- [ ] Squash-merge using "feat: initialize backend core infrastructure"
