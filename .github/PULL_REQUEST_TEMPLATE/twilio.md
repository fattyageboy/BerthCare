## Twilio Integration - Draft PR

**Closes #6**

### Overview

This PR implements Twilio integration for BerthCare, enabling voice alerts, SMS notifications, and webhook handling for real-time communication with users.

### Design Philosophy Alignment

- **Simplicity**: Twilio integration works invisibly in the background
- **User Experience**: Notifications feel natural and timely, not intrusive
- **Quality**: Every message, alert, and interaction is crafted with care
- **Integration**: Seamless connection between backend services and communication layer

### üîí Security & Compliance

#### Encryption & PII Protection

- [ ] Implement app-level field encryption for stored phone numbers using AWS KMS-backed keys
- [ ] Configure database column-level encryption for message content with key alias rotation support
- [ ] Document key management procedures (key creation, access policies, backup/recovery) in security runbook
- [ ] Encrypt phone numbers at rest using AES-256-GCM with per-record data encryption keys (DEKs)
- [ ] Store only encrypted phone numbers in database; decrypt only in memory for API calls
- [ ] Implement webhook signature validation using Twilio's X-Twilio-Signature header verification

#### Credential Management & Rotation

- [ ] Store Twilio credentials (Account SID, Auth Token) in AWS Secrets Manager with automatic rotation enabled
- [ ] Define credential rotation policy: rotate Auth Token every 90 days minimum
- [ ] Implement automated rotation via Secrets Manager Lambda rotation function
- [ ] Document emergency rotation steps (compromise response, immediate rotation trigger, service restart)
- [ ] Add monitoring alerts for credential expiration (30-day, 7-day warnings)
- [ ] Test credential rotation in staging without service disruption

#### Audit Logging & Compliance

- [ ] Define audit log scope: log message ID, recipient country code, delivery status, timestamp, retry count
- [ ] Explicitly forbid logging: full phone numbers, message body content, user PII
- [ ] Implement structured audit logs with consistent schema (JSON format, indexed fields)
- [ ] Add GDPR-compliant data retention: 90 days for operational logs, 7 years for compliance audit trails
- [ ] Create audit log queries for compliance reports (delivery success rates, failed messages by country)
- [ ] Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse (per-user, per-IP, per-endpoint thresholds)

#### Log Sanitization & Redaction

- [ ] Redact phone numbers in logs: store only last 4 digits (e.g., `***-***-1234`) or tokenized IDs
- [ ] Hash phone numbers using HMAC-SHA256 with secret salt for correlation without exposing PII
- [ ] Sanitize webhook payloads before logging: remove `From`, `To`, `Body` fields, keep only `MessageSid`, `Status`
- [ ] Example acceptable format: `{"message_id": "SM...", "status": "delivered", "recipient_token": "hash_abc123", "country": "US"}`
- [ ] Implement log scrubbing middleware to automatically redact PII patterns (phone regex, email patterns)
- [ ] Add unit tests to verify no PII leaks in log output (test with sample phone numbers, message content)

#### Acceptance Criteria & Verification

- [ ] Verify encryption: query database directly and confirm phone numbers are encrypted (not plaintext)
- [ ] Verify rotation: trigger manual credential rotation and confirm service continues without errors
- [ ] Verify audit logging: review logs and confirm only allowed fields are present (no phone numbers, no message bodies)
- [ ] Verify redaction: search all logs for phone number patterns and confirm zero matches of full numbers
- [ ] Conduct security review with compliance team before production deployment
- [ ] Perform penetration testing on webhook endpoints (signature bypass attempts, replay attacks)

## Technical Notes

### Architecture Decisions

- Service layer pattern for clean separation
- Queue-based processing for reliability
- Idempotent webhook handlers
- Graceful degradation if Twilio is unavailable

### Dependencies

```json
{
  "twilio": "^5.x.x"
}
```

### Environment Variables

> **üîí Security Note: Credential Handling**
>
> **DO NOT** commit Twilio credentials to version control:
>
> - Load values from **AWS Secrets Manager** (production/staging)
> - Use **GitHub Actions secrets** for CI/CD pipelines
> - Store in local `.env` files (ensure `.env` is in `.gitignore`)
> - Use environment secret managers (Vault, Parameter Store, etc.)
> - **Rotate keys regularly** and restrict IAM/access permissions
> - Never paste real credentials in PR descriptions or comments

```
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=          # Load from secure secret store
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=           # Load from secure secret store
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=         # Load from secure secret store
TWILIO_WEBHOOK_BASE_URL=     # Public URL, safe to commit
```

## Testing Instructions

1. Set up Twilio test credentials
2. Run unit tests: `npm test -- twilio`
3. Test voice calls to your phone
4. Test SMS delivery
5. Verify webhook callbacks

---

## Performance Considerations

- SMS delivery: ~1-3 seconds
- Voice call initiation: ~2-5 seconds
- Webhook processing: <100ms
- Rate limits: Respect Twilio's API limits

---

## Rollout Plan

1. Deploy to staging
2. Internal testing with team phone numbers
3. Beta testing with select users
4. Gradual rollout to production
5. Monitor metrics and adjust
