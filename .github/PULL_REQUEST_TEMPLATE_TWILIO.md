## Twilio Integration - Draft PR

**Closes #6**

### Overview
This PR implements Twilio integration for BerthCare, enabling voice alerts, SMS notifications, and webhook handling for real-time communication with users.

### Design Philosophy Alignment
- **Simplicity**: Twilio integration works invisibly in the background
- **User Experience**: Notifications feel natural and timely, not intrusive
- **Quality**: Every message, alert, and interaction is crafted with care
- **Integration**: Seamless connection between backend services and communication layer

## Technical Notes

### Architecture Decisions
- Service layer pattern for clean separation
- Queue-based processing for reliability
- Idempotent webhook handlers
- Graceful degradation if Twilio is unavailable

### Dependencies
```json
{
  "twilio": "^5.x.x"
}
```

### Environment Variables
```
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=
TWILIO_WEBHOOK_BASE_URL=
```

---

## Testing Instructions

1. Set up Twilio test credentials
2. Run unit tests: `npm test -- twilio`
3. Test voice calls to your phone
4. Test SMS delivery
5. Verify webhook callbacks

---

## Performance Considerations

- SMS delivery: ~1-3 seconds
- Voice call initiation: ~2-5 seconds
- Webhook processing: <100ms
- Rate limits: Respect Twilio's API limits

---

## Rollout Plan

1. Deploy to staging
2. Internal testing with team phone numbers
3. Beta testing with select users
4. Gradual rollout to production
5. Monitor metrics and adjust
